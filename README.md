# HouseIn: Where Clients and Constructors Meet

**HouseIn** is a platform designed to bridge the gap between clients looking to build or renovate their homes and professional constructors. Our goal is to make the process of finding reliable, experienced constructors easy and transparent. Whether you're looking to build a new house, renovate your existing one, or handle smaller construction projects, HouseIn connects you with the right professionals.

## Features

- **Client-Constructor Matching**: Clients can easily find constructors who specialize in the type of work they need, based on location, budget, and project type.
- **Constructor Profiles**: Constructors can create detailed profiles showcasing their skills, past projects, reviews, and contact information.
- **Transparent Reviews**: Clients can leave reviews and ratings to help others make informed decisions.
- **Affordable Pricing**: Get competitive pricing from trusted professionals, with no hidden costs.
- **Direct Calling with Twilio API**: Clients can call constructors directly using the **Twilio API**, maintaining privacy for both parties. This feature uses a **proxy phone number system**, ensuring that the actual phone numbers of clients and constructors are not exposed, keeping sensitive contact information private.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Create a free account as either a client or a constructor.
2. **Create a Profile**: Constructors can post their construction projects with details such as type of work, location, and budget.
3. **Browse Constructors**: Clients can search for constructors based on location, skills, ratings, and past projects.
4. **Request Quotes**: Clients can request quotes from multiple constructors to compare prices and services.
5. **Choose and Communicate**: Once a constructor is selected, clients and constructors can discuss project specifics, timelines, and costs. 
6. **Direct Call via Twilio**: Clients can directly call constructors using a **Twilio-powered proxy phone number**, which ensures that their actual phone numbers are kept private. 
7. **Completion and Reviews**: After the project is completed, clients can leave a review and rate the constructor’s work.

## Why Choose HouseIn?

- **Convenience**: Easily search and hire constructors from the comfort of your home.
- **Trustworthy**: Our platform ensures that all constructors are vetted, licensed, and experienced in their field.
- **Transparency**: Get clear, upfront quotes and project timelines.
- **Privacy Protection**: We use a **proxy phone number system powered by Twilio** to protect the privacy of both clients and constructors, allowing secure calls without exposing personal contact details.
- **Customer Support**: We offer dedicated customer support to help both clients and constructors through every step of the process.

## Twilio API Integration for Privacy Protection

To maintain the privacy of both clients and constructors, **HouseIn** integrates with the **Twilio API** for secure, direct phone calls. 

### How It Works:
- When a client wants to contact a constructor, they can initiate a call through the platform.
- The call is routed through Twilio’s **proxy phone number system**, which masks the real phone numbers of both the client and the constructor.
- This ensures that both parties can communicate without exposing their personal phone numbers, offering a layer of security and privacy.

### Setup for Twilio API:

- **Twilio API Key**: You need a valid Twilio account and API key to use this feature. [Sign up for Twilio here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
- **Twilio Phone Number**: A Twilio-provided phone number is used as the proxy for calls.
